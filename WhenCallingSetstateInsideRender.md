Calling setState inside the render method of a React component causes infinite re-renders, leading to performance issues and unpredictable behavior (StackoverFlow Error). This happens because each state update triggers a new render, which again calls setState. Instead, state updates should be made in lifecycle methods or event handlers to avoid these problems.

Best Practices:
- Avoid Calling setState in render: Instead, update the state using lifecycle methods like componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, or event handlers.

- Use Derived State: If you need to compute a derived state based on props or another state, do it outside render, such as in a method that gets called during lifecycle events.

- Memoization: Use memoization techniques to avoid unnecessary computations requiring state updates.
