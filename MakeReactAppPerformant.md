MAKE REACT APP PERFORMANT:

Optimizing and improving the performance of a React application involves various strategies to ensure that the app runs efficiently and provides a smooth user 
experience. Here are key techniques to make a React app performant and optimized:

- Code Splitting: Use React.lazy and Suspense to load components dynamically, reducing initial load times.
const LazyComponent = lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'));

- Memoization: Use React.memo for components and useMemo/useCallback for functions and calculations to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
  const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(), [dependencies]);

- Avoid Inline Functions: Define functions outside of JSX to avoid creating new instances on each render.
  <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>

- Virtualize Long Lists: Use react-window or react-virtualized to render only visible items in large lists.
  <List height={150} itemCount={items.length} itemSize={35} width={300}>
    {({ index, style }) => <div style={style}>{items[index]}</div>}
  </List>

- Optimize Assets: Use optimized image formats and lazy load images to reduce loading times.
  <img src={imageSrc} loading="lazy" alt="description" />

- Efficient Data Structures: Choose appropriate data structures for better performance.

- Reduce Reconciliation: Use unique key props for list items to help React manage updates efficiently.
  {items.map(item => <ListItem key={item.id} item={item} />)}

- Production Build: Ensure you're using the production build for optimizations like minification.
  npm run build

- Monitor Performance: Use tools like React DevTools and Lighthouse to identify and fix performance issues.

Implementing these strategies helps improve React app performance and user experience.
