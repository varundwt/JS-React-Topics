The request life cycle refers to the series of steps that occur when a web application makes an HTTP request, from initiation to receiving a response. Hereâ€™s a high-level overview of this life cycle:

1. Request Initiation:
User Action: The process begins when a user action triggers an HTTP request, such as clicking a button, submitting a form, or loading a page.
JavaScript Code: Alternatively, the request can be initiated programmatically using JavaScript libraries like Axios, Fetch API, or through built-in browser methods.

2. Request Preparation:
Creating Request: The request is prepared by specifying the method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), URL, headers, body (for methods like POST), and other configurations.
Encoding: If necessary, the request body is encoded (e.g., as JSON) before being sent.

3. Sending Request:
Network Layer: The request is sent to the server through the browser's network layer or the server's client-side code, using protocols like HTTP or HTTPS.
Transport: The request is transported over the internet, potentially passing through various network devices and servers.

4. Server Processing:
Receiving Request: The server receives the HTTP request and begins processing it.
Handling: The server-side code (e.g., API endpoints, server-side logic) processes the request, performs necessary operations (like querying a database), and prepares a response.

5. Sending Response:
Generating Response: The server generates an HTTP response, which includes a status code, headers, and body content (e.g., HTML, JSON).
Transport: The response is sent back to the client over the internet.

6. Receiving Response:
Network Layer: The response is received by the browser or client application, which processes it.
Parsing: The client parses the response, extracting relevant data and converting it if necessary (e.g., JSON parsing).

7. Handling Response:
Updating UI: Based on the response, the client-side code updates the user interface or performs further actions (e.g., displaying data, handling errors).
Error Handling: If the response indicates an error (e.g., status codes 4xx or 5xx), the client-side code handles these errors appropriately (e.g., showing error messages).

Summary:
Request Initiation: Triggered by user action or code.
Request Preparation: Configuring and encoding the request.
Sending Request: Transporting the request over the network.
Server Processing: Server processes the request and generates a response.
Sending Response: Server sends the response back to the client.
Receiving Response: Client receives and parses the response.
Handling Response: Client updates UI or handles errors based on the response.
