Semantic elements in HTML are elements that clearly describe their meaning in a human- and machine-readable way. These elements improve the structure, accessibility, and SEO of web pages by giving context to the content.

Common Semantic Elements:
<header>: Represents introductory content, usually at the top of a page or section.
<nav>: Defines a block of navigation links.
<main>: Represents the main content of the document.
<article>: Represents a self-contained piece of content, such as a blog post.
<section>: Defines a section in a document, often used to group content thematically.
<aside>: Represents content that is tangentially related to the main content, like sidebars or advertisements.
<footer>: Represents the footer of a page or section, usually contains metadata or links.
<figure> and <figcaption>: Used for images and their captions.
Importance of Semantic Elements:
Accessibility: Helps screen readers and other assistive technologies understand the structure and purpose of the content.
SEO: Search engines better understand the structure and content of the webpage, improving rankings.
Maintainability: Makes code more readable and easier to maintain.
Using semantic elements promotes cleaner and more meaningful HTML.
