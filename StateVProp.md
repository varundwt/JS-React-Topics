In React, state and props are two fundamental concepts used to manage and pass data within components. While they serve different purposes, understanding how they work and differ is crucial for building React applications effectively.

State
Definition: State is an object that holds data that can change over time and affects the rendering of a component.
Ownership: Managed within a component. Each component can have its own state.
Mutability: State is mutable, meaning it can be updated or changed using the setState method (in class components) or the state updater function (using the useState hook in functional components).
Usage: Used to track and manage data that changes over time or in response to user actions, such as form inputs or toggles.

Example (Functional Component with Hooks):

import React, { useState } from 'react';
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0); // Declare state variable 'count'

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}

Props
Definition: Props (short for properties) are a mechanism for passing data and event handlers from a parent component to child components.
Ownership: Managed by the parent component. Child components receive props from their parent.
Mutability: Props are immutable within the child component. A child component cannot change the props it receives; it can only use them.
Usage: Used to pass data, event handlers, and configuration to child components. Props allow components to be reusable and customizable.

Example:
function Greeting({ name }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}

function App() {
  return <Greeting name="Alice" />;
}

Key Differences

Management:
State: Managed within the component that owns it. It is local and can be updated by the component itself.
Props: Passed from parent to child components. They are read-only in the child component and used to configure or render the child.

Mutability:
State: Mutable. Components can update their own state using setState or the state updater function.
Props: Immutable. Child components cannot modify the props they receive; they can only use them.

Purpose:
State: Used for data that needs to change over time or in response to user interactions.
Props: Used to pass static or dynamic data from a parent component to child components.

Lifecycle:
State: Changes to state trigger re-rendering of the component.
Props: Changes to props passed from a parent component cause the child component to re-render.

Summary:
State: Internal to a component, mutable, used for dynamic data that changes over time.
Props: External to a component, immutable, used to pass data and functions from parent components to child components.
