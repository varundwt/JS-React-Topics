BOM:
The Browser Object Model (BOM) is a set of objects provided by the browser that allows JavaScript to interact with the web browser itself. It provides functionality for manipulating browser features and handling events related to the browser. Here are the key components of BOM:

- window: The global object representing the browser window. Provides methods for alerts, navigation, and accessing document, location, history, and navigator.
- document: Represents the loaded HTML document. Allows manipulation of the page content (e.g., document.getElementById(), document.createElement()).
- location: Manages and provides information about the current URL (e.g., location.href, location.reload()).
- history: Handles browser history navigation (e.g., history.back(), history.forward()).
- navigator: Provides information about the browser and operating system (e.g., navigator.userAgent, navigator.geolocation).
- screen: Provides information about the user's screen (e.g., screen.width, screen.height).

DOM (Document Object Model) and BOM (Browser Object Model) are both browser interfaces but serve different roles:
DOM: Manages and manipulates the structure and content of a web page (HTML/XML). It provides methods to interact with elements, attributes, and handle events.
BOM: Provides interaction with the browser environment. It includes features for managing the URL, browser history, and accessing browser and screen information. Key components include window, location, history, navigator, and screen.

In essence, DOM deals with web page content, while BOM handles browser functionalities.....
