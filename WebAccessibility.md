Web Accessibility:
  Accessibility in web design means creating websites everyone can use, including people with disabilities.
  It’s about making sure that all users, no matter their abilities, can navigate, understand, and interact with your website easily.
  By focusing on accessibility, you not only help people with disabilities but also improve everyone's overall user experience.
What to Implement:
  Image Descriptions: Alt text should be added to images so screen readers can describe them to users with visual impairments.
  Keyboard Navigation: Ensuring the website can be fully navigated using a keyboard for users who can’t use a mouse.
  Captions and Transcripts: Providing captions for videos and transcripts for audio content to help users with hearing impairments.
  Color Contrast: Using high-contrast colors to make text and other elements easy to see for everyone, including those with color blindness.
