Keys in React are used to:

Efficiently Update Lists: Keys help React identify which items have changed, added, or removed, allowing for minimal updates and efficient rendering.
Preserve Component State: They ensure components maintain their state correctly, even when items in a list are reordered or modified.
Improve Performance: Proper use of keys reduces unnecessary re-renders by ensuring React only updates components that have changed.
Keys should be unique and stable, typically using IDs or other unique values for each list item.
