To stop unnecessary re-renders in child components in React:

Use React.memo: Wrap functional components with React.memo to memoize their rendering and prevent re-renders unless props change.
Implement shouldComponentUpdate: In class components, use shouldComponentUpdate to control re-rendering based on prop or state changes.
Use useCallback: Memoize callback functions with useCallback to avoid recreating them on every render.
Optimize Context Usage: Use useMemo to stabilize context values and reduce unnecessary updates that trigger re-renders.
Avoid Inline Functions and Objects: Define functions and objects outside of JSX to prevent creating new references on every render.
These techniques help manage and optimize rendering performance by ensuring components only re-render when necessary.
