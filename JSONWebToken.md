JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact, URL-safe token format used for securely transmitting information between parties. It is commonly used for authentication and authorization in web applications.

Key Concepts of JWT:

Structure:
Header: Contains metadata about the token, such as the type of token and the signing algorithm used (e.g., HS256 for HMAC SHA-256).

{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}

Payload: Contains the claims or the data you want to transmit. This can include registered claims (like sub for subject, exp for expiration), public claims, or private claims.

{
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "iat": 1516239022
}

Signature: Used to verify that the sender of the JWT is who it says it is and to ensure that the message wasn't changed along the way. It is created by combining the encoded header and payload with a secret key and applying the specified signing algorithm.

HMACSHA256(
  base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +
  base64UrlEncode(payload),
  secret)

How It Works:
Token Creation: When a user logs in, the server creates a JWT with user information and signs it with a secret key.
Token Transmission: The JWT is sent to the client and stored (usually in local storage or cookies).
Token Usage: The client includes the JWT in the Authorization header of subsequent requests to access protected resources.

Authorization: Bearer <token>
Token Verification: The server verifies the JWT's signature using the secret key to ensure its validity and authenticity.

Claims:
Registered Claims: Standard claims defined by the JWT specification (e.g., iss for issuer, exp for expiration).
Public Claims: Custom claims that can be used to share information but should be registered in the IANA JSON Web Token Claims registry to avoid name collisions.
Private Claims: Custom claims used between parties that agree on them but are not registered or standardized.

Benefits:
Stateless: JWTs are self-contained, meaning they carry all the information needed for authentication, reducing server load and the need for session storage.
Secure: The signature ensures that the token has not been tampered with. However, sensitive information should not be stored in the payload unless encrypted.
Portable: JWTs are URL-safe and can be easily transmitted in HTTP headers or as URL parameters.

Security Considerations:
Secret Management: Keep the signing secret or key secure. Compromised secrets can lead to token forgery.
Token Expiration: Implement token expiration (exp claim) to limit the lifespan of tokens and reduce the impact of token theft.
Sensitive Data: Avoid storing sensitive data in the payload unless it is encrypted, as JWTs can be decoded by anyone who has the token.

Summary:
JWT: A standardized, compact token format used for secure data transmission and authentication. It consists of a header, payload, and signature, and is commonly used for stateless authentication and authorization in web applications.
