IIFE (Immediatly involted function Expression) -

Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE) are JavaScript functions that are executed immediately after they are defined.
They are typically used to create a local scope for variables to prevent them from polluting the global scope.

  (function (){ 
  // Function Logic Here. 
  })();
