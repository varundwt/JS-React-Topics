Pure Functions are functions that always produce the same output for the same input and
do not cause side effects (i.e., they donâ€™t modify external state). They are predictable 
and easy to test.
Example of a Pure Function:
  function add(a, b) {
    return a + b; // Always returns the same result for the same inputs
  }

Impure Functions may produce different outputs for the same inputs because they depend 
on or modify external state. They can have side effects like altering global variables 
or performing I/O operations.
Example of an Impure Function:
  let count = 0;
  function increment() {
    count += 1; // Modifies external state (count)
    return count;
  }

Key Differences:
Pure Functions: Consistent output, no side effects.
Impure Functions: Output can vary, may have side effects.
