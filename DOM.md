DOM -
The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface that represents the structure of a webpage as a hierarchical tree of nodes. 
It allows developers to access, modify, and manipulate the content, structure, and styles of web pages dynamically using JavaScript or 
other languages. The DOM also enables event handling for user interactions like clicks or key presses, making web pages interactive and 
dynamic. It is cross-platform and language-independent, though most commonly used with JavaScript in web browsers.
