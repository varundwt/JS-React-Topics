//An immediately invoked function expression, or IIFE (pronounced iffy), is a function that is called immediately after it is defined. 

// Use Cases Of IIFE :
// Avoid polluting the global namespace.
// To create closures in JavaScript.
// IIFE is used to create private and  public variables and methods.
// It is used to execute the async and await function.
// It is used to work with require function.


(function IIFE(){
    console.log("I am an IIFE.");
})();
