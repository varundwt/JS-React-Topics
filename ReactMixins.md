React Mixins -
React Mixins were a way to reuse code logic between components before the advent of Hooks. Mixins were reusable sets of functionalities
that could be added to React components. They allowed the encapsulation of common functionalities and behaviors, enabling components to
inherit and use them.
However, React mixins are not used as often as they once were because they have been replaced by more modern solutions like higher-order
components (HOCs) and hooks.
